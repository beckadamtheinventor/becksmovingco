# Junk Sale Pricing
We’ll pay 1 diamond per shulker of junk, with some exceptions.
+ Shulkers entirely filled with non-stackables such as junk armour and tools are valued at 1 diamond per 8 shulkers. We're likely gonna lava it anyways.
+ Shukers entirely filled with stone (and/or variants), and/or cobblestone are valued at 3 diamonds per 2 shulkers.
+ Shulkers entirely filled with dirt, coarse dirt, gravel, and/or coal ore are valued at 2 diamonds per shulker.
Final sale diamonds are rounded down to the nearest diamond, and the remainder is noted as an IOU.
All sales are final, and will only be made with the best interest of all parties involved.
